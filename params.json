{"name":"Pops","tagline":"Platform ops in one executable","body":"## Overview\r\nA single executable to do all the useful Ops commands.\r\n\r\nPops is meant to be used by all developers. So they don't have to bother setting up Ruby environment to use [platform_ops](https://github.com/MYOB-Technology/platform_ops).\r\n\r\nIf this works well, we may consider rewriting more and more stuff from `platform_ops` into `pops`.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Why creating another repo?\r\n- No runtime dependencies. Much easier to distribute to any user without setting up ruby environment and building gems.\r\n- Much much faster. This is important for quick tasks. For instance, `knife data bag show` took 6s while `pops` can do it in under 0.1s.\r\n- Single command to do everything, just like `git`.\r\n- Self-documented with `--help`.\r\n- Open source, including all the dependencies. No need to use your ssh key to pull the source or use the distribution.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\nCheck [releases](https://github.com/MYOB-Technology/pops/releases) for downloads. Put the executable into your $PATH. That's it.\r\n\r\n## Current available commands\r\n- `dec` Decrypt Chef data bag\r\n- `enc` Encrypt Chef data bag\r\n- `db up` Start the database\r\n- `db init` Init the database\r\n- `db down` Destroy the database\r\n- `rand iv` Generate an random initialization vector\r\n- `rand secret` Generate an random secret (Can be used to encrypt/decrypt Chef data bag)\r\n\r\nYou can get the usage of all commands by `pops [command] -h`\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
